    body_description: `<div>
        <p>Just had a conversation with my friends; they are currently stationed at the Limansk front
        and actively engaged in combat operations. They are going through a tough time and are in need of assistance,
        counting on our support.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="font-bold mt-4">Background:</div>
      <div class="mt-2">
        On my previous birthday, I purchased a Mavic-3 drone, and my buddies were thrilled with it.
        The drone performed remarkably well, but unfortunately, it got shot down.
      </div>

      <div class="font-bold mt-4">Relevance:</div>

      <div class="italic mt-2">Why Dnipro-1?</div>
      <div class="ml-2">- I have friends in several units on the Donetsk fronts, and after talking to all of them,
      it's evident that Dnipro-1 requires urgent support.</div>

      <div class="italic mt-2">Why a Drone?</div>
      <div class="ml-2">
        - The most pressing request was for drones, and I happen to have expertise in their procurement and delivery.
        However, they also need Ecoflow power stations.
      </div>

      <div class="italic mt-2">Why am I doing this independently rather than through a foundation?</div>
      <ul class="ml-2">
        <li> - I want to conserve the resources of volunteers; processing each request consumes their valuable time.</li>
        <li> - I want to save donor resources; purchasing items directly is more cost-effective. I buy them offline in
         Europe and utilize tax-free at the border, allowing the saved money to be used for the next donation.</li>
        <li> - I want to establish effective communication with the participants involved in this project.
        (About the project)</li>
